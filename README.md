- It was developed using NextJS 13.4, TypeScript and SASS
- It has unit tests where I'm using Jest and Testing-Library

- Note: I wasn't able to display 12 results per page without losing data of a some characters due to Rick and Morty API doesn't support limit of results per page and it's not possible to retrieve all characters in one call.
